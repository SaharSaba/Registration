Spine anatomical (MR) and functional (fMR) images registration:

To obtain the best correspondences between two image sets (3D Images). Our method was based on the efficient implementation of the variational method (non-parametric)

The result of the registration process is to fuse information of MRI and fMRI to provide better analysis of patients' spine abnormalities for surgeons and neuroscience 
specialists.
